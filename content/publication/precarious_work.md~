Independent contractors, foreign or domestic temporary workers, social-services workers and so many others confronting the sudden casualization of employment in their sector all inhabit the ever-growing categories of precarious work. To see how we got here, we need to look at where we came from: In the book Precarious employment: causes, consequences and remedies, the reader will find an in-depth study of the early forms of precarious work that have emerged and thrived in the last 30 years and a  detailed look at many facets of that work."
