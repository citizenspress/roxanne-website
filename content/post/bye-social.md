Be advised that you will no longer find me on the corporate social media networks I used to frequent, namely Facebook, Instagram and X (formerly known as whatever). 

I am far from the first to exit stage left from this space that has become simply uninteresting, if not unbearable.

I look past on the last 15 years of presence on social media and remember some of the good times. 

The thrill of being in the know and discovering new voices and issues in the early days of twitter. The curated (by me) feed of headlines based on my interests or files I followed. 

Using networks to organize mass actions, rallies, or to turn an issue around through careful engagement.

Reconnecting to long lost friends and keeping up with everyone's activities. Building a visual diary of my trips and photos of things I loves. 

Those times are long gone, and in fact are so distant at this point that I can barely remember, from day to day, why I keep trying to get those good times back.

Without going too far into the reasons many people are choosing to leave corporate social media, here are mine:

- I am tired of wasting time and getting angry on social media.
- I want to make space for content creation and creative/original writing.
- I don't want to settle for these networks when there truly are so many other ways for us to interact online.
- I don't want to let tech giants define how we (I) use the internet.
