Roxanne is a proud Franco-Ontarian who was born in St. Catharines,  Ontario and grew up in Lafontaine, near the town of Penetanguishene.

Roxanne studied Communications and Globalization at the University of  Ottawa. While at school, she worked as the Arts and Culture editor for  La Rotonde, the francophone student newspaper. She also produced and  hosted radio shows on community and student radio stations. She has  maintained a passion for community media from a very young age.

In 2007, as part of an internship, she spent three months in Montreal  pursuing a community website development course. She was then assigned  to the international secretariat of the World Social Forum in Nairobi,  Kenya, for three months.

In 2008, Roxanne got elected as Vice-President Finance at the Student  Federation of the University of Ottawa. She filled that role for two  years, where she was an elected executive of the students’ union. She  oversaw a team of 150 staff, administered the budget, and supported  activists on campus who were advancing social justice causes.

Roxanne then got elected as national treasurer, and subsequently  national chairperson of the Canadian Federation of Students. In her  role, she supported the work of student activists across the country in  advocating for accessible post-secondary education, ending violence  against women on campus and building student and worker solidarity. She  coordinated numerous lobby weeks, a national day of action, and  supported the 2012 Quebec student strike.

After her elected term, Roxanne began working for the Communications,  Energy and Paperworkers’ union in Ottawa. She was assigned to special  projects, one of which was the formation of a new union between CEP and  the Canadian Autoworkers. Roxanne was part of the working group  structure that was composed of members of both union and would lead to  Unifor.

In Unifor, Roxanne was assigned the community chapter project which  aimed to develop a union structure for workers who cannot organize in  traditional ways. As part of this assignment, she worked with  freelancers, independent contractors, temporary agency workers and  others who wanted to create a union voice for themselves and their  community. As part of the Organizing Department at Unifor, Roxanne  supports field organizers by planning, resourcing and implementing union  organizing drives. She also develops the youth network and provides  tools and training for young workers to organize.

Roxanne has always maintained an active writing practice throughout her  life. She is also an avid reader, and a fan of creative projects from  writing to basic graphic design, from photography to knitting, and more.
