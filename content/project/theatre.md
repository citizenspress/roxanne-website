Roxanne is a long-time theatre goer and is currently experimenting with playwriting. She proudly serves as a member of the Board of Administration of the Théatre français. The Théatre français has been producing French plays in Toronto for 50 years. 

Every season, the theatre produces several plays ranging from Franco-Ontarian productions, new creations and French repertoire, such as Corneille, Molière and others. 

Roxanne is passionate about promoting theatre as a way to reflect, challenge and influence current thinking. As a member of the board, she always seeks opportunities for the Théatre français to be a voice for the broader community in Toronto, and expanding the definitions of the Francophone community.
