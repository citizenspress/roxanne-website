# Biography


I am a bilingual union organizer, avid reader and writer based in Toronto, Ontario. I am a proud Franco-Ontarian who was born in St. Catharines and grew up in Lafontaine on the shores of Georgian Bay.

I have more than 15 years of experience in strategic campaign and project development, including policical, awareness, and organizing campaigns at all stages. I have served as national chairperson of Canada's largest democratic student union and am currently the Director of Strategic Planning for Unifor.

I am passionate about building worker power and democracy, fighting for improved labour standards and strengthening unions and social movements.
